Pitch

I want to create an article that shows the data on the violence suffered by the LGBTQI community in Colombia between 2020 and 2021 according to the official report of the Defensoria del Pueblo. I would like to use statistics and percentage graphics to show the type of violence this community endures, the numbers of what specific community is more affected, how many cases in every region of the country, etc. I also would like to show the numbers from the last 5 years to compare how the cases have increased. In general I would like data to help me illustrate a panorama of the risks of living in Colombia as a person with diverse sexual orientation or gender expression.
